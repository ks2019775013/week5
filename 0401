vi Commands
vi commands are used in "screen" mode (the default), where you use the commands to move around the screen and to per-
form operations on the text.

Most vi commands follow a general pattern:
	[command] [number] textobject
or the equivalent form:
	[number] [command] textobject

Moverment Commands
vi movemet commands distinguish between two kinds of "words." The lowercase commands define a word as a contig-uous
sequence of underscores, letters, and digits. The upper- case commands define a word as a contiguous sequence of non
whitespace characters.
